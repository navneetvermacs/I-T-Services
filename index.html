          <b>Ans.: </b>The goal is for OpenNMS to be a truly distributed, scalable platform for all aspects of the FCAPS network management model, and to make this platform available to both open source and commercial applications. Currently, OpenNMS focuses on three main areas:
			<li>Service Polling - determining service availability and reporting on same.</li>
			<li>Data Collection - collecting, storing and reporting on network information as well as generating thresholds.</li>
			<li>Event and Notification Management - receiving events, both internal and external, and using those events to feed a robust notification system, including escalation.</li>
			The OpenNMS Group is the commercial entity that funds the OpenNMS application development.

      <h2>Online IT Assets and Network Management System</h2>
      <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="images/services/opennms.png" alt="OpenNMS - Online IT Assets & Network Manager Homepage">
	  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Open NMS</p>
      <p class="item-details">
	   The OpenNMS Project was started in July, 1999 by Steve Giles, Brian Weaver and Luke Rindfuss and their company PlatformWorks. It was registered as project 4141 on Sourceforge in March 2000. On September 28, 2000, PlatformWorks was acquired by Atipa, a Kansas City-based competitor to VA Linux Systems. In July 2001, Atipa changed its name to Oculan. In September 2002, Oculan decided to stop supporting the OpenNMS project. Tarus Balog, then an Oculan employee, left the company to continue to focus on the project.<br>
	   In September 2004, The OpenNMS Group was started by Balog, Matt Brozowski and David Hustace to provide a commercial service and support business around the project. Shortly after that, The Order of the Green Polo (OGP) was founded to manage the OpenNMS Project itself. While many members of the OGP are also employees of The OpenNMS Group, it remains a separate organization. Some of the Open NMS Notable features are:
	   <li><b>Event Management and Notifications - </b><br>
		OpenNMS is based around a "publish and subscribe" message bus. Processes within the software can publish events, and other processes can subscribe to them. In addition, OpenNMS can receive events in the form of SNMP Traps, Syslog messages, TL/1 events or custom messages sent as XML to port 5817. Events can be configured to generate alarms. While events represent a history of information from the network, alarms can be used to create correlation workflow (resolving "down" alarms when matching "up" alarms are created) and performing "event reduction" by representing multiple, identical events as a single alarm with a counter. Alarms can also generate events of their own, such as when an alarm is escalated in severity. Alarms clear from the system over time, unlike events that persist as long as desired.
       </li>
       <li><b>Discovery and Provisioning - </b><br>
		OpenNMS contains an advanced provisioning system for adding devices to the management system. This process can occur automatically by submitting a list or range of IP addresses to the system (both IPv4 and IPv6). Devices can also be expressly added to the system, as well as a combination of the two. The underlying technology for this configuration is XML, so users can either use the web-based user interface or they can automate the process by scripting the creation of the XML configuration files.
       </li>
	   <li><b>Service Monitoring - </b><br>
	    The service assurance features of OpenNMS allow for the availability of network-based services to be determined. The types of monitors span from the very simple (ICMP pings, TCP port checks) to the complex (Page Sequence Monitoring, Mail Transport Monitor). Outage information is stored in the database and can be used to generate availability reports. In addition to being able to monitor network services from the point of view of the OpenNMS server, remote pollers can be deployed to measure availability from distant locations.
       </li>
	   <li><b>Data Collection - </b></br>
		Performance data collection exists in OpenNMS for a number of network protocols including SNMP, HTTP, JMX, WMI, XMP, XML, NSClient, and JDBC. Data can be collected, stored, graphed as well as checked against thresholds. The process is highly scalable, and one instance of OpenNMS is collecting 1.2 million data points via SNMP every five minutes.
       </li>
	   <li><b>Additional Features - </b><br>
		OpenNMS is accessed via a web-based user interface built on Jetty. Integration with JasperReports creates high level reports from the database and collected performance data.
       </li>

      <p class="item-details">
	   Moodle is free and open-source software learning management system written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. Developed on pedagogical principles, Moodle is used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other e-learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces and other sectors.<br>
	   With customizable management features, it is used to create private websites with online courses for educators and trainers to achieve learning goals. Moodle (acronym for modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment) allows for extending and tailoring learning environments using community sourced plugins.<br>
	   <b>E-learning standards support</b><br>
	   Moodle has adopted the following e-learning standards:<br>
	   <li>
	    Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) is a collection of elearning standards and specifications that define communications between client side content and a server side learning management system, as well as how externally authored content should be packaged in order to integrate with the LMS effectively.<br>
        There are two versions: SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004. Moodle is SCORM 1.2 compliant, and passes all the tests in the ADL Conformance test suite 1.2.7 for SCORM 1.2. SCORM 2004 is not supported in Moodle, however Rustici Software have a Moodle plugin which can turn any Moodle site into a fully compliant SCORM 2004 LMS.

	    The AICC HACP standard for CMI was developed by the Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee (AICC) and is used to call externally authored content and assessment packages. AICC content packages are supported in Moodle 2.1 and later versions.

	   <li>
	    IMS Content Packages can also be imported into Moodle. In addition, Moodle Book activities can be exported as IMS Content Packages.

	    Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a standard way of integrating rich learning applications (often remotely hosted and provided through third-party services) with educational platforms. Moodle uses the External Tool activity to act as an 'LTI consumer' as standard, and will act as an 'LTI provider' using a plugin.
